# Data Science Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Meet 👋

I'm documenting my journey into Data Science & Machine Learning. This isn't a polished portfolio—it's my actual learning process, mistakes included.

## Why This Repo?

I believe the best way to learn is to build in public. Every notebook here represents hours of practice, confusion, and eventually understanding. No shortcuts, just consistent effort.

## Current Focus

🎯 **Now Learning:** Python Fundamentals  
📅 **Started:** January 2026

## Learning Log

I maintain a daily log of what I learn, struggle with, and figure out.  
→ **[View Learning Log](./LEARNING_LOG.md)**

## Open Questions

Questions I'm exploring as I learn. Some answered, some still figuring out.

## Connect

Learning the same stuff? Let's connect and grow together.

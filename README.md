# Data Science Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Meet 👋

I'm documenting my journey into Data Science & Machine Learning. This isn't a polished portfolio—it's my actual learning process, mistakes included.

## Why This Repo?

I believe the best way to learn is to build in public. Every notebook here represents hours of practice, confusion, and eventually understanding. No shortcuts, just consistent effort.

## Current Focus

🎯 **Now Learning:** Python Fundamentals  
📅 **Started:** January 2026

## What's Inside

| Section | Topics | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Python Fundamentals | Variables, Control Flow, Data Structures | 🔄 In Progress |
| Object-Oriented Programming | Classes, Inheritance, Composition | 🔜 Coming Soon |
| NumPy | Arrays, Operations, Broadcasting | 🔜 Coming Soon |
| Pandas | *Planned* | 🔜 Coming Soon |
| Machine Learning | *Planned* | 🔜 Coming Soon |

## Learning Log

I maintain a daily log of what I learn, struggle with, and figure out.  
→ **[View Learning Log](./LEARNING_LOG.md)**

## Open Questions

Things I'm curious about (will update as I learn):

- [ ] Why is NumPy faster than Python lists?
- [ ] When to use OOP vs functional programming in data science?
- [ ] What makes a good ML project for a portfolio?

## Connect

Learning the same stuff? Let's connect and grow together.

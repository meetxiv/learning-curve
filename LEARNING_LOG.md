### Day 1 | Jan 3, 2026

**What I did:**  
Set up this repository and planned my learning path. Decided to document everything publicly.

**Why Data Science?**  
I've always been curious about how data drives decisions. Instead of just watching tutorials, I'm committing to building real understanding through practice.

**My approach:**  
- Start with strong Python fundamentals (most jobs require this)
- Don't rush to ML—understand the foundations first
- Document what I learn, including mistakes
- Build small projects as I go

**Today's realization:**  
There's no shortcut. Everyone who's good at this put in the hours. My job is to show up consistently.

**Next:** Starting with Python basics—variables, data types, operators.
